# 14 JavaScript DOM Challenges

This repository contains 14 hands-on JavaScript challenges focused on DOM manipulation and user interaction.

### 🎯 Goal
To strengthen my ability to work with JavaScript and the DOM confidently, relying on internal understanding rather than external help. These challenges are designed to simulate real-world interactivity and deepen my mental models through repetition and reflection.

## ✍️ Rules

- No use of Google or AI during the initial attempt.
- Write down stuck points and guesses before checking documentation (if needed).
- Focus on vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks or libraries.
- Track personal growth with short reflections after each challenge.

## ✅ Outcome

By the end of these 14 challenges, the goal is to:
- Increase confidence in writing interactive JavaScript
- Think more independently when debugging
- Build better mental models through self-practice
