# Hamburger Menu

A simple responsive hamburger menu built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Toggle navigation menu on mobile view
- Uses `classList.toggle()` to show/hide nav links
- Responsive layout using media queries

## How It Works

- The menu button appears when the screen width is 600px or less.
- Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the `active` class on the `.nav-links` element.
- When `.active` is present, the nav links are displayed vertically.
